NodeJack
========

A simple interactive node.js blackjack application using socket.io

blackjack has a few simple OO models created in javascript per game:

*Deck
*Card
*Game

there is also a user created per games stored in the database
since mongodb is so flexible (YOU CAN STORE FUNCTIONS! (but really shouldn't (still though, cool))) you could theoretically store entire games in the database as a save feature.  We'll put that in our C-level functionality
